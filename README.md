R shiny application of a life stage specific suitability model for visualization of fisheries spatial distributions

Managing fisheries in the context of climate change is challenging for several reasons including those related to shifts in fish abundance and spatial distribution. Fishery species often have several life stages within their life cycles, each of which can tolerate only certain environmental conditions. Unfortunately, most models of fishery abundance and spatial distribution take into account only a few environmental parameters, and do not consider the complex life histories associated with fish lifecycles. Furthermore, most models require a decent amount of technical expertise to use, including software coding skills. This technical report outlines a simple new modeling approach for determining species spatial distributions that takes into account multiple environmental parameters and life stages. It also includes results of testing this approach on a specific fishery, the Indonesian Blue Swimming Crab (IBSC) fishery. General results show that the approach has potential to provide valuable insights into estimates of fishery spatial distributions. Finally, this report describes an R shiny application which enables those who lack coding skills to still make use of this modelling approach.
