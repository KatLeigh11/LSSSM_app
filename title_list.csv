"Weighted Normalized Difference of Predicted/Recorded Values from Ideal Values for Each Parameter per Life Stage per Depth for Blue Swimming Crab, Historical (1956 - 2020), Future (2010 - 2100)","The differences between average recorded (for historical data, time period: 1956-2020) and predicted (for future data, time period: 2010-2100) values and ideal values specific to each blue swimming crab life stage (egg, zoea, megalopae, juvenille, and adult) for each parameter (temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen) were calculated for every latitude-longitude pair at four depths (surface, 30m, 100m, and bottom). These differences were then normalized across both time periods, all parameters, all life stages, and all depths. The color scale is broken into quantiles specific to the data displayed. Normalization and quantile scale allows for comparisons between time periods, parameters, depths, and life stages.",all

These differences were then normalized across both time periods, all parameters, all life stages, and all depths. Finally, these normalized differences were used to calculate conducivity rankings for each latitude-longitude pair. Conducivity rankings are the weighted averages of the normalized differences.
